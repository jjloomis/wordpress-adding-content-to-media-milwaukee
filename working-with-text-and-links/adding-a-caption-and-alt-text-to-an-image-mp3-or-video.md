# Adding a Caption and Alt Text to an Image, MP3, or Video

Every multimedia item in a post should have a caption. A caption lets a visitor know the context of the item while providing credit to the content creator. 

### Adding a caption and credit

A caption should be a full sentence that follows AP style.

Credit for original image, MP3, or video should appear in this format: Photo: Your Name 

Credits for an image, MP3, or video from an authorized source should appear in this format: Photo: Authorized Source Name

1. In a post, click the image, MP3, or video.
2. Click in the **Write caption...** area ****\(beneath image, MP3, or video.\) Add your caption and credit.
3. When finished, click **Save Draft**.

### Adding alt text 

Every image in a post needs an alt text \(alternative text\) description. Alt text is necessary for accessibility devices \(such as screen readers\) and provides Search Engine Optimization \(SEO\) benefits. 

1. In a post, click an image.
2. In the **Settings** panel \(on right\), make sure the **Block** tab is active. In the **Block** tab area, scroll down to the **Image settings** area \(click the down arrow to expand this area, if necessary.\) 
3. In the **Alt text** box, add a brief description of the content of the photo.
4. When finished, click **Save Draft**.
