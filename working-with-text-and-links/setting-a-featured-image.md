# Setting a Featured Image

A featured image is the image that appears in a home page box \(**Top Stories**, **Headlines**, etc.\) When using the **Advanced** template, the featured image is also the hero image \(large image on top\) of the story.

A featured image must be a landscape-oriented image. Minimum dimensions are 2048 x 1536 pixels. If you take photos with a modern phone or camera, the picture will meet \(or exceed\) these dimensions. Photos downloaded from social media or other websites will not meet the minimum dimensions. 

**Note**: Refrain from resizing or cropping images prior to upload. 

1. In a post, make sure the **Document** tab is selected \(on right.\)
2. Scroll down to the **Featured Image** area \(on right.\)
3. Click **Set featured image.**
4. In the **Featured Image** box, use the **Upload** tab to navigate to and select an image on your computer. Or, use the **Media Library** tab to select an image that was previously added to the site.
