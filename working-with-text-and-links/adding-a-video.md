# Adding a Video

### Adding a video to a post

Before adding a video to a story, you'll need to upload it to YouTube or Vimeo. Then, you'll copy and paste the video's URL into your story. Never upload a video file directly to Media Milwaukee. 

1. If you haven't already done so, export your video and upload it to YouTube or Vimeo.
2. Copy the URL of the video.
3. In a post, click the **Add block** button. Select YouTube or Vimeo.
4. Past the video's URL in the **Video** block. Click the **Embed** button.
5. If necessary, [align and resize the video](aligning-and-resizing-a-video.md).
