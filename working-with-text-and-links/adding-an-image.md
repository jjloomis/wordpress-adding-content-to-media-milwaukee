# Adding an Image

### Renaming images

Before uploading an image, give it a relevant name following [JAMS file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/file-and-folder-naming-conventions.html). 

Renaming an image before uploading it to Media Milwaukee makes it easier to find in the site's Media Library. Renaming images also lets other users and instructors know who took the photo. 

A good approach to follow when naming image files is to use this approach: subject-your-last-name.jpg. If you have multiple images related to the same subject, you can add a number \(-1, -2, -3, etc.\) to the end of the name as well. Note: Always maintain the file extension \(.jpg, .png, etc.\) 

A properly renamed image might look like this: election-day-loomis-3.jpg.
