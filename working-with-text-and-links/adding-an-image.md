# Adding an Image

### Renaming images prior to upload

Renaming an image before uploading it to Media Milwaukee makes it easier to find in the site's Media Library. Renaming images also lets other users and instructors know who took the photo. 

A good approach to follow when naming image files is to use this approach: subject-your-last-name.jpg. If you have multiple images related to the same subject, you can add a number \(-1, -2, -3, etc.\) to the end of the file name as well. **Note**: Always maintain the file extension \(.jpg, .png, etc.\) 

A properly renamed image might look like this: election-day-loomis-3.jpg.

### Adding an image directly to a story

1. In a post, click the **Add block** button \(plus sign.\) Select the **Image** block. \(**Note**: Do not select **Image Compare** or **Slideshow**.\)
2. To upload an image, click the **Upload** button. Navigate to and select the image on your computer.
3. To select an image from the Media Library, click the **Media Library** button. Select the image you'd like to use and click the **Select** button.
