2. Enter a title for your post.
3. Add text, images, and other media as needed.
4. Add a featured image if you have one available. 
5. Edit your URL, if necessary. 
6. To preview your post, click **Preview**. **Note**: This will open a new tab in your browser. Be sure to work with the original tab when making changes to your post.
7. When finished, click the **Publish** button and then select **Submit for Review**.
